The [curam-kubernetes](https://github.com/merative/curam-kubernetes) repository provides the following Helm Charts:

* *apps:* defines how to deploy the IBM® WebSphere® Liberty images with Cúram.
* *batch:* defines the batch image configuration.
* *uawebapp:* defines how to deploy the Universal Access (React) application.
* *web:* defines how to deploy the static content image for Cúram (`Curam` image only).
* *mqserver:* defines the IBM WebSphere MQ image configuration.
* *xmlserver:* defines the xmlserver container configuration.
* *spm:* an umbrella chart to contain all the other charts.

The charts use a templating mechanism to create the YAML file that is used by Kubernetes.
For this reason, the main configuration values are stored for each chart in a `values.yaml` file in the main folder of the charts.
The values can also be overwritten by the `spm:*` umbrella chart or by a provided override file during deployment as described in [Deploying Helm Charts](/deployment/hc_deployment).

YAML is a human-readable structured data format. It provides powerful configuration settings, without having to learn a more complex code type like CSS, JavaScript, or PHP.

## Preparing to run the Helm Charts

Before you run the charts, you must configure the database, configure IBM MQ, resolve all chart dependencies, and test the charts.
You may also optionally integrate your deployment with an ISAM server for SSO enablement,
to do so complete the steps on the [Enabling ISAM](/supporting-infrastructure/ISAM) page under Supporting Infrastructure before returning here.

Many of the Helm Charts that make up a deployment of Cúram depend on the [IBM Shared Configuration Helpers](https://github.com/IBM/charts/tree/master/samples/ibm-sch) chart, so an extra Helm repository must be added using the following command:

```shell
helm repo add sch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/samples
helm repo update
```

### Configuring the Helm Chart

A catalog of available configuration options is available in the [Configuration Reference](/deployment/config-reference) topic.

While you may change the values in your local copy of `helm-charts/spm/values.yaml`, it is strongly recommended to use a values override file with your custom options.

<InlineNotification>

Sample override files for Minikube, AKS, and CRC are also available in the `$SPM_HOME/static/resources` folder. We have provided a minimum
spec required for a successful deployment in these files, with more options for overriding commented out. The config options from the
[Configuration Reference](/deployment/config-reference) topic should be used with these files.

In November 2020, Docker introduced [download rate limits](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/) on Docker Hub.
This can be mitigated by providing an Image Pull Secret to the deployment using the `global.hubPullSecret.secretName` value.

</InlineNotification>

### Configuring IBM MQ

IBM MQ is already configured to work out of the box with a secure connection with IBM WebSphere Liberty.
The commands that create all the objects that are needed on the queue manager are defined in a config map, in the `configmap-mqsc.yaml` file.

The password for the IBM MQ web console can be retrieved from the created Secret resource using the following command **after** it has been deployed:

```shell
kubectl get secret <releaseName>-mq-credentials -o go-template='{{.data.adminPasswordKey | base64decode}}{{"\n"}}'
```

## Packaging the Helm Charts

To use the Helm Charts to install SPM, package the charts and load them into a repository. For more information, see [ChartMuseum](/prereq/chartmuseum).

For each chart, its dependencies must be resolved before it can be loaded into a Helm repository like Chart museum.

<InlineNotification>

Due to a Helm [defect](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5780), conditional subchart enablement does not work in Helm 3.
As a result of this, `uawebapp` needs to be packaged and pushed, irrespective of whether you are deploying it or not.
It is possible to remove the dependency from the Cúram `chart.yaml`, if you do not wish to package and push it to the repo.

If you made any changes to any of the charts, these can now be verified using the `helm lint` and `helm template` commands, for example:

To publish the individual charts to the Chart museum repository, run the following commands from the `helm-charts` folder. The commands also use the `$SPM_HOME` value that is defined in [Install prerequisite software](/prereq/git):

In October 2021, Helm `v3.7.0` introduced a number of breaking changes, which required modifications of the tooling used in this runbook. For local development, Cúram requires [chartmuseum/helm-push](https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push).

Due to the changes introduced as part of Helm `v3.7.0` and Chart museum `v0.10.0`, when using Chartmuseum the target `helm push` has changed to `helm cm-push`
