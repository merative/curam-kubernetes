In Cloud environments, all the components of the platform must be up-to-date because of the often short maintenance cycles.

## Kubernetes

The Kubernetes project gets minor releases approximately every three months, and it maintains only the three most recent minor releases.

Managed Kubernetes services like AKS and EKS have a hands-off upgrade process, whereby the upgrade is performed with the click of a button.
Before upgrading, review all the release notes between the source and target versions because Kubernetes features can change over time.

<InlineNotification kind='warning'>

**Warning:** Kubernetes upgrades cannot be rolled back. Always make sure to do the upgrade on a development cluster before proceeding to higher environments.

Alongside the upgrade of the Kubernetes service, ensure you upgrade any pipelines and developer tools with a compatible version of `kubectl`. The command-line tool must be within one minor version (older or newer) of the Kubernetes service.

## Helm

Starting with Helm v3, there is no server-side component, so the process of upgrading the command-line tool is a case of replacing the binary.
As with any software, make sure to review the Helm [Release Notes](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases) before upgrading.

## Middleware components

Because of the immutable nature of containers, when the application middleware (for example, IBM® WebSphere® Liberty) needs to be updated, new application images must be built upon a new base image.
The new images should then be promoted throughout the software development lifecycle using the methods outlined in [Updating Cúram Deployment](/operations/updating_curam).
