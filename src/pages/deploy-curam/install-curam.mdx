## Cúram installers

Cúram release that supports deployment to Kubernetes requires running a full Cúram 8.2.0.0 platform installer, which you can download from [Cúram Support](https://merative.my.site.com/mysupport/s/).

## Installing Cúram

Before you run an installer JAR file, you must have your Cúram `license` folder in the location where you run the installer command.

Run each of the installers (full or delta) using the following steps:

* Substitute `<installername.jar>` with your actual installer file name to run the following command:

    ```shell
    java -jar <installername.jar>
    ```

The command starts the Cúram (izPack) installer.

* If _Select the language of the application_ is left blank, _English - United States_ is the default language.
* If the language dialog is empty,  clicking _Next_ installs the default English language.
* If you require additional languages, restart the installer until the dialog is displayed.
