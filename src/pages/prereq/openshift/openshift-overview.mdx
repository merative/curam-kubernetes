OpenShift is a family of containerisation software products developed by RedHat. It's flagship product, OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), can be used to
configure and deploy Cúram. More information about OCP can be found in the [OpenShift Container Platform](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/welcome/index.html) documentation.

CodeReady Containers (CRC) is a minimal cluster that is designed to run on your local workstation as a development environment for OpenShift. Steps to deploy
Cúram using CRC can be found in the [CodeReady Containers tab](/prereq/openshift/codeready-containers). Further information can be found in the [official CRC repository](https://github.com/crc-org/crc).
