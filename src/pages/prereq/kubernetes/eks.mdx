## What is EKS?

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), designed to simplify the deployment, operation, and scaling of Kubernetes clusters.

As a CNCF-certified Kubernetes provider, EKS manages the Kubernetes control plane, handling tasks like high availability, patching, and scalability across multiple AWS availability zones. It streamlines the setup and management of worker nodes while integrating with AWS-native services for networking, identity, and security.

EKS offers key Kubernetes features including intelligent scheduling, self-healing, horizontal scaling, service discovery, load balancing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management.

Advanced capabilities include fine-grained container security, pod- and namespace-level isolation, and the flexibility to design and manage clusters to suit your architecture. EKS integrates with AWS tools like IAM, CloudWatch, and ECR, ensuring secure and consistent operational workflows.

EKS provides a secure, production-grade environment with built-in security controls, CIS benchmarks, and support for industry standards like PCI, HIPAA, SOC 1, and SOC 2 compliance.
