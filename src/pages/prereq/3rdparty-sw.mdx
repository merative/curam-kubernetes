## IBM WebSphere Liberty

WebSphere Liberty is the only application server supported by Cúram on Kubernetes and is therefore required.

When installed, create an environment variable `WLP_HOME` that points to the WebSphere Liberty installation directory. For example:

```shell
WLP_HOME=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty
```

## Java Requirement

As of the Cúram 8.2 release, Cúram supports `Java 8` and `Java 21` , the latest version of Java will be referred to as `ModernJava`.

See [Cúram Supported Prerequisites](https://curam-spm-devops.github.io/wh-support-docs/) for the latest list of supported Java versions and JDK distributions.

After installing Java, set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable as follows:

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=$WLP_HOME/java/<version>
  ```

* Add `$JAVA_HOME/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.

Because of compatibility differences between Java 8 and Java 21, the Dockerfiles used by Cúram have been separated into version-specific directories. Java8 and ModernJava. These directories are referenced using the placeholder `$CURAM_JAVA_MODE` in this documentation.

Be sure to check the `dockerfiles/Liberty` directory to confirm that you're using a supported Java version.

## Database

A supported relational database is required. See [Cúram Supported Prerequisites](https://curam-spm-devops.github.io/wh-support-docs/) for list of supported databases.

## Apache Ant

When using Java 8, Apache Ant `1.10.6` is required.

When using ModernJava, Apache Ant `1.10.15` is required.

| ANT_OPTS | -Xmx1400m -Dcmp.maxmemory=1400m | |
| ANT_VERSION_VALUE | based on the Java version | `1` |
| ANT_LIB_PATH | point to the `CuramSDEJ/lib/nashorn` path | `2` |

|Notes|
|-|
|`(1)` Based on the Cúram version you install.|
|`(2)` This is only required for Java 21.|

* Add $ANT_HOME/bin to the PATH environment variable
* Include `ANT_LIB_PATH` in your `PATH`.
