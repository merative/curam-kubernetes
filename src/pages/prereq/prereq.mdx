Cúram was enhanced in version 7.0.10.0 to enable it to be deployed on cloud native hosting platforms.

To build and run Cúram for Kubernetes, install the following software components:

* [Base third-party software](/prereq/3rdparty-sw)
* [Cúram software](/deploy-curam/install-curam)
* [Docker®, and Helm](/prereq/docker-helm)
* [Kubernetes](/prereq/kubernetes/kubernetes-overview)
  * [minikube](/prereq/kubernetes/minikube)
  * [ChartMuseum](/prereq/chartmuseum)
* [OpenShift](/prereq/openshift/openshift-overview)
  * [CodeReady Containers](/prereq/openshift/codeready-containers)
* [GitHub repo](/prereq/git)

In order to be hosted on Kubernetes, Cúram has been enhanced to support the following technologies:
