IBM MQ is a queue managing service from the IBM stack. To support Kubernetes, changes to Cúram were required.

For more information about Cúram Kubernetes architecture changes, see **Kubernetes architecture** in the *Cúram on Kubernetes Guide*.

When Cúram is containerized on Kubernetes, it uses IBM MQ to manage JMS messages for Cúram Deferred Processes and Cúram Workflows. For more information about MQ, see [About IBM MQ](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/9.1?topic=mq-about).

If MQ fails, certain functionality will be unusable. This includes and is not limited to, creation of a case and creation of an application. In order to reduce the likelihood
of this, MQ can be configured to be a multi-instance deployment. This results in a stateful set being created, with one active/primary queue manager, and one standby/secondary queue manager.

Currently, MQ can be configured on [VMs](/prereq/mq/mq-on-vms), EKS or [OpenShift](/prereq/mq/mq-on-openshift).

**Note**: Non-Openshift environments must use standalone VMs in production. Please refer to [IBM MQ support statement](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/9.3?topic=integration-planning-mq-in-containers) for more information.
