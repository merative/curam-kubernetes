## Networking

[Network Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-networking.html) in Kubernetes in EKS are used to determine object communication.
They can be implemented using [Kubernetes network policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cni-network-policy.html), [Ingress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html) and [Restrict traffic between pods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cni-network-policy-configure.html).

Ingress works by exposing services internal to the cluster via external endpoints. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.
