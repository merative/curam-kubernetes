## Storage

Before you get started with provisioning storage, it is important to understand the Kubernetes concepts of a `PersistentVolume` (PV) and a `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) and how they work together in a cluster.

Information for this can be found here at [App Data storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/storage.html) on the Amazon EKS documentation site.
