## Authentication

All EKS clusters have two categories of users: service accounts managed by IAM Roles for Service Accounts, and normal users.

EKS uses client certificates, bearer tokens, an authenticating proxy, or HTTP basic auth to authenticate API requests through authentication plugins.

Information about [EKS API's](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) can be found within the link. [Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-auth.html) and be found with the link.
