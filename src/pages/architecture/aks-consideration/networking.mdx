## Networking

[Network Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-network) in Kubernetes in AKS are used to determine object communication.
They can be implemented using [Kubernetes network policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/kubernetes-network-policies), [Ingress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/ingress-basic?tabs=azure-cli) and [Secure traffic between pods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-network-policies).

Ingress works by exposing services internal to the cluster via external endpoints. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.
