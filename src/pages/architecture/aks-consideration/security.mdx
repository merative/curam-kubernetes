## Security

AKS supplies many options to create a secured deployment. There is no one-size-fits-all solution that can be used everywhere, so a certain degree of familiarity with these options is required.
We recommend implementing the best practices that were highlighted in the below links and use AKS flexible configuration capabilities to incorporate security processes into the continuous integration pipeline,
automating the entire process with security seamlessly “baked in”.

Both [Pod Security Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-pod-security-policies), [Security Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-security) and [Best practices for cluster security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-cluster-security?tabs=azure-cli) give an overview of AKS concepts and guidelines of security.
