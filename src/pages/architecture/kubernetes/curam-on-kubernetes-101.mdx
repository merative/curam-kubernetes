If this is your first time looking into the topic of Cúram on Kubernetes, this is the right place to start.

Now, before moving forward on the specifics, take a look at the videos available in this section to familiarise yourself with the main concepts of a containerised architecture on Kubernetes.

The first thing you need to know is that Cúram introduced five new mandatory technologies to deploy on Kubernetes.

| Technology | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| Azure Kubernetes Services  | Highly scalable platform to orchestrate containerised applications on Azure. |
| Red Hat OpenShift  | Highly scalable platform to orchestrate containerised applications on any environment supported by Red Hat. |
| Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services| Alternative scalable platform to orchestrate containerised applications provided by Amazon. Recommended for internal test only. |
| WebSphere Liberty | Cúram Application Server for cloud native architectures on Kubernetes. |
| Helm | Consistently deploy containerised applications into Kubernetes. |
| Docker | Package Cúram into containers for seamless environment portability. |
| IBM MQ | Enterprise-grade messaging engine to move JMS messages for Cúram on cloud native architectures. |
