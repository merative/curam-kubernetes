[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager that helps you to find, share, and use software that is built for Kubernetes.
Helm streamlines the installation and management of Kubernetes applications, and is the equivalent of the apt, yum, or homebrew utilities for Kubernetes.

Helm uses a packaging format called Chart. A chart is a collection of files that describes a related set of Kubernetes resources.
A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or a complex deployment, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, and caches.
