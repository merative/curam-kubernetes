## Security

Beyond what a platform such as OpenShift Container Platform offers out of the box, your organization will likely have its own security demands.
Some level of compliance verification might be needed before you can even bring OpenShift Container Platform into your data center.

Likewise, you may need to add your own agents, specialized hardware drivers, or encryption features to OpenShift Container Platform, before it can meet your organizationâ€™s security standards.

Here [Understanding container security](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/security_and_compliance/container-security-1#security-understanding) can help with pointers to questions teams might have.
