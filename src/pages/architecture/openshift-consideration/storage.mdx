## Storage

Managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute resources. OpenShift Container Platform uses the Kubernetes `PersistentVolume` (PV) framework to allow cluster administrators to provision persistent storage for a cluster.
Developers can use `PersistentVolumeClaims` (PVCs) to request PV resources without having specific knowledge of the underlying storage infrastructure.

More information can be found in the [Persistent storage overview](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/storage/understanding-persistent-storage) page on OpenShift.
