### What is Keycloak?

Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management tool that allows applications to handle authentication and authorization through a central service.
It supports industry standards like OpenID Connect (OIDC), enabling features such as Single Sign-On (SSO), and role-based access control.
Keycloak manages users, roles, and applications (clients) within isolated spaces called realms, and acts as an OIDC provider by issuing tokens after successful authentication.
This simplifies security integration across multiple applications and services.
