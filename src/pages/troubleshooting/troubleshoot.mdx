## Log Collection

To copy logs from container to the host, enter the following command:

```shell
docker cp <containerId>:/file/path/within/container /host/path/target
```

If it is necessary to navigate the DockerÂ® container to find log files, enter the following command:

```shell
docker exec -it [container-id] bash
```

## Errors in the Docker Registry

The Docker registry can be a source of errors, which might occur when `docker push` commands are run. Errors like the following may be seen:

* `Get https://minikube.local:5000/v2/: http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client`
* `Get http://minikube.local:5000/v2/: dial tcp 192.168.39.112:5000: connect: no route to host`

The errors can occur if the registry is not properly configured. Some platform-dependent ways to investigate the errors are as follows:

Ensure that the IP reflected by the `minikube ip` command is specified in the following locations:

* `/etc/hosts` - Ensure that there is a `minikube.local` entry that matches the Minikube IP address. If necessary, modify the file.
* `/etc/docker/daemon.json` -  Ensure that the specified subnet matches the Minikube IP address. If necessary, edit the file and restart the Docker service. ChartMuseum must also be restarted.
* `minikube start` command `--insecure-registry` option - When this command is used, ensure that the specified subnet matches the Minikube IP.

For the Minikube insecure registry the following is covered in the [Minikube](/prereq/kubernetes/minikube) topic:

* Ensure that if Minikube has been stopped (e.g., from a reboot), it has been restarted and redeployed using a "fresh" Minikube VM (`minikube delete` first).
* Ensure the `--insecure-registry` option on the `minikube start` command reflects the appropriate value as indicated in the
  [Minikube handbook](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/registry/#enabling-insecure-registries): `--insecure-registry "10.0.0.0/24"`.
* If not using Docker inside the Minikube VM (`minikube docker-env`): Confirm the location of the Docker `daemon.json` file
  (`C:\ProgramData\Docker\config\daemon.json` or `$env:USERPROFILE\.docker\daemon.json`, depending on the installation) and ensure it specifies a matching `insecure-registries` setting.

Confirm the registry with the following command:

`curl http://minikube.local:5000/v2/_catalog`

The command should return a result similar to:

```json
{"repositories":["batch","curam","httpd","rest","servercode","utilities","xmlserver"]}
```

**Note:** An empty repository returns: `{"repositories":[]}`
