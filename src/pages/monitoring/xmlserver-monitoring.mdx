## Introduction

Monitoring of the XML server is available through:

* ![Cúram 8.1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Cúram_8.1.0.0-green) Health checks, described in [XML server health checks](#xml-server-health-checks)

## XML server health checks

![Cúram 8.1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Cúram_8.1.0.0-green) A readiness and liveness probe are available for xmlserver deployments.
These probes complement each other to ensure the xmlserver service is not accessed until it is ready and remains available.

In support of the probes a folder, `xmlserverprobes` has been added to the `/opt/ibm/Curam/xmlserver` folder in `xmlserver` containers.

To enable these probes you need to enable them in your Helm override file.
Depending on your local environment you may need to adjust the timing values to achieve successful operation.
See the [XML Server Configuration Reference](/deployment/config-reference#xml-server) topic and the K8s
[Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) page for more information.

### readinessProbe

The readinessProbe depends on this info level log4j message: "`XML Server awaiting connections on port`". Thus, if you have modified the default `xmlserver` log4j configuration to suppress this message you cannot use the readinessProbe.

### livenessProbe

The livenessProbe adds messages such as these to the `/opt/ibm/Curam/xmlserver/tmp/xmlserver.log` file for each probe invocation (default 30 seconds):

```
[xmlserver] [INFO] [XMLConnectionHandler] Mon Apr 03 12:28:02 BST 2023 Connection received.
[xmlserver] [INFO] [XMLConnectionHandler] Awaiting job configuration.
[xmlserver] [INFO] [XMLConnectionHandler] Probe check received.
```
