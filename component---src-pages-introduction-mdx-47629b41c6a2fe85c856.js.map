While earlier versions could be deployed using an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) model, that approach did not provide the full benefits of flexibility, elasticity, efficiency and the strategic advantages associated with cloud-native architectures.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This runbook provides engineering teams with a guide to deploying Cúram on Kubernetes. It is intended as a starter framework not as a rigid prerequisite, offering reference architectures, tested configurations and extensible tooling. Instruction for deploying Cúram locally using tools like CodeReady Containers (CRC) and Minikube are included.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For enterprise-scale environments, the runbook outlines best practices for deploying on Red Hat OpenShift, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). As part of Cúram 8.2, AKS is fully supported for production use and EKS is supported for development and test environments, giving organizations more flexibility in aligning with their cloud infrastructure of choice.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Included Helm charts and Dockerfiles serve as baseline implementations to accelerate setup. While Helm and Docker are required technologies (see `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/curam-kubernetes/prereq/prereq\"\n      }}>{`Prerequisite software`}</a>{`), these assets are intended to be adapted or extended to fit specific project or organizational needs.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Cúram 8.2 also introduces full support for Java 21, reflecting a strategic move away from the aging Java 8 runtime, which is nearing end-of-life across most vendors. The transition can be disruptive, especially when considering third-party libraries and open-source dependencies. To ease the transition, this runbook provides separate Dockerfiles for Java 8 and Java 21, enabling a smoother migration path based on your current environment.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXLayout","DefaultLayout","MDXContent","_ref","components","props","_objectWithoutProperties","_excluded","mdx","Object","assign","mdxType","parentName","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
