# apps

## Introduction

* The Apps chart is a component of CÃºram Platform responsible for providing the Liberty runtime of the application.

## Chart Details

* Deployment of a single pod listening on port 8443
* Exposed to the cluster using a service for potential load balancing
* Starting from `curam-kubernetes` release `21.7.0`, chart versions have been updated to align with the release version.

## Prerequisites

* [`PodDisruptionBudgets`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) are recommended for high resiliency in an application during risky operations, such as draining a node for maintenance or scaling down a cluster.
* Access to a populated enterprise database.
